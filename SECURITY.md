# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We value security for the project very highly.
If you find a security vulnerability in the Symblai project, kindly email us at <a href="mailto:your@mail.com">addyour@mailid.com</a> instead of posting a public issue in GitHub.
If you had any minor issues, bugs, or want to share about your experience, feel free to do so on our at our support channel of <a href="https://bit.ly/symbldotai-slack">Slack</a>.
One can also post the the issues in the <a href="https://github.com/symblai/Symbl-powered-Agora-RTE-app/issues">issues section of the github repo</a>.

At this juncture, we don't have a bug bounty program. We are a small team trying to solve a big problem. We urge you to report any vulnerabilities responsibly
so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community.
